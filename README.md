### Hi there 👋

I’m a Frontend developer since 2015, through all this time I've been learning and improving my knowledge of frontend technologies, design skills, user experience, and new ways to develop amazing interfaces. I work with the technologies React, Typescript, and Javascript. I have good knowledge of Figma projects to extract layouts and make them available to users.
