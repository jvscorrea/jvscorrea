### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Frontend developer for 9 years, through all these years I've been learning a lot of things about user experience and new ways to develop amazing interfaces. I work with the technologies React, Typescript, and Javascript. I have good knowledge of Figma projects to extract layouts and make them available on the web.
